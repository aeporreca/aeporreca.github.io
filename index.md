I am a postdoctoral research fellow at Dipartimento di Informatica, Sistemistica e Comunicazione (Department of Computer Science, Systems and Communication) of Universit√† degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, Italy.

My current research interest is the computational complexity theory of natural computing systems, in particular membrane systems (or P systems) and reaction systems.
