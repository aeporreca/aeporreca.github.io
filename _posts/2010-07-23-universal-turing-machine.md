What did Alan Turing have in mind when he conceived his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_turing_machine">universal computing machine</a>?

One could speculate that his train of thoughts was like this:

<ol>
<li>I can simulate any of my machines (there's experimental evidence, and of course I defined them to work like people doing maths on a piece of paper).</li>
<li>I've already formulated a computability thesis that says: if I can do it, then a computing machine also can.</li>
<li>But then, there must be a universal computing machine! Let's fill in the details…</li>
</ol>

Or maybe he came to that realisation some completely different way. Possibly, directly from Gödel's work?

Who knows, maybe there even exists something written by Turing himself on this subject.
