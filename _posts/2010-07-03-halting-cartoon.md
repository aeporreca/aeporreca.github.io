Bob is a programmer and software engineer, developing automated software testing utilities for his company. However, his manager Eve wants to fire him and, in order to get an excuse, she assigns him a very hard task: developing a tool to check the termination of programs. Eve, for some reason, seems to know that he's doomed to failure.

Fortunately, the exhausted Bob receives a visit in his dreams by someone important, who explains the problem to him and helps him get his revenge.
