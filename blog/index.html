<a href="/blog/nash-beats-godel/">Nash beats Gödel: On the history of complexity and cryptography</a>
</h2>

<p class="post-date">17 February 2012</p>

<p>We know that Kurt Gödel, unhappy with having only completeness and incompleteness theorems named after him, also essentially invented the <strong>P</strong> vs <strong>NP</strong> question in a <a href="http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/the-gdel-letter/">1956 letter to John Von Neumann</a>. Unfortunately, there were no blogs back then, so we had to wait until the 1980s to read it, and Cook, Karp &amp; co. had to reinvent the question from scratch.

<a href="/blog/length-of-proofs-2/">On the length of proofs (episode II)</a>
</h2>

<p class="post-date">12 July 2010</p>

<p>Last week I wrote a <a href="/2010/07/04/length-of-proofs/">post</a> about arithmetical theorems having very long proofs, and linked to an <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel/#SpeUpThe">article</a> on the <abbr title="Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy">SEP</abbr> for the details. Today, me and my colleague Luca Manzoni realised that there is a much simpler proof; it is essentially the same <a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/bignumbers.pdf">proof</a> described by Scott Aaronson for the uncomputability of the busy beaver function, and it holds for any undecidable, recursively axiomatisable theory $T$ (that is, if there exists a recursive set of axioms generating the sentences of the theory, but no decision procedure for checking whether a sentence is a theorem).

<a href="/blog/primitive-recursion/">How I learned to stop worrying about Turing completeness and love primitive recursion</a>

<p class="post-date">11 July 2010</p>

<p>The primitive recursive functions are a class of computable arithmetic functions with a reasonably natural <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_recursive_function#Definition">definition</a>. They do not exhaust all computable functions (e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function">Ackermann’s function</a> grows faster than any <abbr title="primitive recursive">PR</abbr> function). Here is a list of reasons to like them anyway. [<a href="/blog/primitive-recursion/">read more…</a>]</p>

<p>One of the most amazing facts about (un)computability is the existence of functions $f \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ that <em>grow faster than any recursive function</em>, that is, for all computable $g \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ we have [<a href="/blog/length-of-proofs/">read more…</a>]</p>
