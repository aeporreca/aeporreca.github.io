<h1 id="title">The semiring of dynamical systems</h1>
<p class="post-date">28 June 2020</p>
<p>This is a post about something I‚Äôm working on at the moment, the semiring of finite, discrete time dynamical systems. Here‚Äôs a picture to get you interested, a portion of the multiplication table of dynamical systems (everyone loves thisÔ∏è).</p>

<p><img src="/files/blog/dstable.png" style="max-width: 100%" /></p>

<p>Here, a dynamical system $(A,f)$ is just a finite set $A$ of states (including $\varnothing$) with a state transition function $f \colon A \to A$ (any function will do). Each such dynamical system consists of one or more limit cycles with oriented trees having the points of those cycles as their roots.</p>

<p>You can define operations on dynamical systems (modulo isomorphism) and obtain a semiring $(\mathbf{D},+,√ó)$.</p>

<p>The sum $+$ is defined as $(A,f) + (B,g) = (A‚äéB, f+g)$ where $(f+g)(x) = f(x)$ if $x ‚àà A$ and $(f+g)(x) = g(x)$ if $x ‚àà B$. The empty dynamical system $0_{\mathbf{D}} = (\varnothing, \varnothing)$ is the identity of $+$.</p>

<p>The product $√ó$ is $(A,f) √ó (B,g) = (A√óB, f√óg)$ where $(f√óg)(x,y) = (f(x),g(y))$. The dynamical system with one point $1_{\mathbf{D}} = (\{x\},\mathrm{id})$ is the identity of $√ó$.</p>

<p>In terms of graphs of the dynamics $(V,E) = (A, \{ (x,f(x)) : x ‚àà A \})$, the sum is disjoint union and the product is the tensor (or Kronecker) product.</p>

<p>$(\mathbf{D},+,√ó)$ has the natural numbers $(‚Ñï,+,√ó)$ as a subsemiring. It‚Äôs the image of the injective homomorphism $œï: ‚Ñï ‚Üí \mathbf{D}$ defined as $œï(n) =$ the dynamical system consisting of exactly n fixed points. These behave as expected with respect to the others, e.g., $œï(n) √ó A = \underbrace{A + ‚ãØ + A}_{n \text{ times}}$.</p>

<p>$(\mathbf{D},+,√ó)$ is quite complex as a semiring. There are infinitely many elements with multiple factorisations into irreducibles, the smallest one being $C‚ÇÇ+C‚ÇÇ = (C‚ÇÇ)¬≤ = 2C‚ÇÇ$, where $C‚ÇÇ$ is the cycle of length two (see the table above). We don‚Äôt know yet which are its prime elements, or if any exists at all.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the majority of elements of $\mathbf{D}$ are irreducible. More specifically, we have $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\text{# reducible dyn. systems of size } n}{\text{# dyn. systems of size } n} = 0$. This was proved by Valentina Dorigatti in her master‚Äôs thesis.</p>

<p>You can study a form of (de)composition of dynamical systems by considering polynomial equations. In the following the polynomials are always over $\mathbf{D}[\vec{X}]$ or its subsemiring $‚Ñï[\vec{X}]$, with many variables $\vec{X} = (X_1,‚Ä¶,X_n)$. The general form of an equation is $p(\vec{X}) = q(\vec{X})$, since you cannot move everything to the left-hand side due to the lack of subtraction.</p>

<p>Each equation $p(\vec{X}) = q(\vec{X})$ over $\mathbf{D}[\vec{X}]$ has an associated equation $p(\vec{X}) = q(\vec{X})$ over $‚Ñï[\vec{X}]$, obtained by replacing each dynamical system $A$ by its size $|A|$. If $p,q ‚àà ‚Ñï[\vec{X}]$ are polynomials over $‚Ñï$ and $(A_1,‚Ä¶A_n)$ is a solution in $\mathbf{D}$ to $p(\vec{X}) = q(\vec{X})$, then $(|A_1|,|A_2|,‚Ä¶)$ is another solution, this time over the naturals.</p>

<p>So, by searching for solutions in the larger semiring $\mathbf{D}$ we might sometimes find new solutions to equations with natural coefficients, but only if a natural solution already exists. This means that Hilbert‚Äôs 10th problem over $\mathbf{D}$ has a negative answer! There is no algorithm for deciding if an equation over $\mathbf{D}[\vec{X}]$ has a solution (much less finding one), otherwise you could use that algorithm for $‚Ñï[\vec{X}]$ too.</p>

<p>Equations with a constant side like $p(\vec{X}) = A$ with $p ‚àà \mathbf{D}[\vec{X}]$ and $A ‚àà \mathbf{D}$ are decidable and in $\mathsf{NP}$: since $+$ and $√ó$ are monotonic with respect to the size of the dynamical systems, the value $|A|$ gives you a bound to the size of the solution, which you can guess and check in polynomial time.</p>

<p>You can do the check in polynomial time because the graphs of the dynamics, being just some cycles with trees going into them, are planar; the graph isomorphism problem for planar graphs is in $\mathsf{L} ‚äÜ \mathsf{P}$, and actually <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/CCC.2009.16">complete for it</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, deciding if $p(\vec{X}) = A$ has a solution is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete. We can prove it by reduction from One-in-three 3SAT, the problem of finding if a Boolean formula $\varphi$ in ternary conjunctive normal form has a satisfying assignment where exactly one literal per clause is true.</p>

<p>For each variable $X$ of formula $\varphi$ we construct an equation $X + X‚Äô = 1$. Here $X‚Äô$ represents the literal $¬¨X$, and exactly one of $X$ and $X‚Äô$ will be $1$, while the other will be $0$. For each clause, e.g., $(X_1 ‚à® ¬¨X_2 ‚à® X_3)$, we have an equation $X_1 + X_2‚Äô + X_3 = 1$, which forces exactly one literal to $1$, and the others to $0$.</p>

<p>This gives us a system of $m$ linear equations of the form $p_i(\vec{X}) = 1$. By multiplying all left- and right-hand sides we get $‚àè_{i=1}^m p_i(\vec{X}) = 1$, which has the same solution as the system of linear equations. This proves the $\mathsf{NP}$-hardness, but only uses the subsemiring $‚Ñï$ of $\mathbf{D}$.</p>

<p>With a little more work, and thanks to the colleague Florian Bridoux and the research intern √âmile Touileb I‚Äôm currently supervising, we can prove that deciding if a <em>single</em> linear equation over $\mathbf{D}[\vec{X}]$ has solution is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete; this finally exploits its non-natural elements.</p>

<p>With another research intern I supervised, Caroline Gaze-Maillot, we have recently analysed dynamical systems $(A,f)$ more abstractly, in terms of their ‚Äúprofiles‚Äù $(|A|_1,|A|_2,‚Ä¶)$, where $|A|_i$ is the number of points at distance $i$ (in terms of number of applications of $f$) from their limit cycle.</p>

<p>We discovered that the profiles of dynamical systems also form a semiring $(\mathbf{P},+,√ó)$, with ‚Äútaking the profile‚Äù being a semiring homomorphism $\mathbf{D} ‚Üí \mathbf{P}$, and this is also complicated stuff, with multiple factorisations, polynomial equations that are undecidable or $\mathsf{NP}$-complete, etc.</p>

<p>Shout-out to everyone who worked on this: Florian Bridoux, Alberto Dennunzio, Valentina Dorigatti, Enrico Formenti, Caroline Gaze-Maillot, Maximilien Gadouleau, Luca Manzoni, Luciano Margara, Valentin Montmirail, Sara Riva, √âmile Touileb.</p>
